I'm a third year NHS Trainee Clinical Scientist in Computing/Informatics, and recentish  Biomedical Engineering graduate. My interests and experiences are at the interface between healthcare, engineering and data science. I'm particularly interested in exploring the application of my skills to problems in healthcare, medicine and the NHS.

Previously, I've worked on projects within synthetic biology, multi-modal sensor data fusion and computer vision based navigation. More recently, my work as part of my training scheme has been around clinical information systems, as well as medical natural language processing. Coming from an interdisciplinary background I find the technical complexity of such systems, coupled with their practical need in improving people's lives a rewarding area to work within.
