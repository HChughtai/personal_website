I'm currently working as a Senior Research Software Developer at UCL. Previously I was a Clinical Scientist in Scientific Computing at UCLH having completed the NHS Scientist Training Programme in Clinical Bioinformatics (Physical Sciences). 

My interests and experiences are at the interface between healthcare, technology and data - particularly where translational research works to improve the NHS and the experience of those who use and work in it.

Previously, Iâ€™ve worked on projects within synthetic biology, multi-modal sensor data fusion and computer vision-based navigation. More recently, my work has been around clinical information systems and medical natural language processing, as well as system management and software engineering process design.
